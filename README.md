# Uncertainty_Quantification
These project includes python codes prepared to demonstrate the application of fully static based, data driven proxy models in uncertainty quantification of underground reservoirs\n
The prepared project includes several codes:
  1- prepared code for reading the geological grid properties and calculating different geological features around the wells 
  2- prepared code for reading the dynamic behavoir from a simulation case and calculating the missfit from a base case (History)
  3- prepared code for developing a data based proxy model to predict the geological realizations capability in matching a history. 
  4- prepared code for clustering the geological realization to select the most representative reallization in prediction of underground performance under geological uncertainty.
